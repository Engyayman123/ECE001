    <p style="color:black"> A program is a set  of instructions written in  a language 
     (such as  BASIC) understandable  by the computer to perform a particular function on 
   the computer. A well written program could be parceled well to form an application package 
 customized for solving specific type of problem on the computer system. A  computer  programmer
 is  computer  scientist  (a  professional)  skilled  in  using  constructs  of programming  languages 
 to  develop  executable  and  acceptable  computer  programs.  A  software developer is  a programmer.
 Programmers  often work hand  in hand with  system analysts  on large projects. Programming  languages 
 are  artificial  notational  languages  created  or  developed  to  be  used  in preparing coded instructions
 on the computer for later execution by the computer. They are usually composed of  series of  usage rules 
  (syntax) that  determine the  meaning (semantics) of expressions written  in  the  language.  Each 
   programming  language  comes  handy  with  its  own  translator  i.e interpreter or compiler as the case
  may be. Programming  is  the  art  of developing  computer  programs  with the  aid of  selected  programming
   language by a computer programmer. It is a special skill whose quality is tested by the quality of the resulting
    program or software.  In programming, programming stages must be properly followed, i.e from problem definition
   to maintenance."</p>
