      Most programming languages consist of the computer instructions. There are
       programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions instead of
       programming languages generally. The early ones preceded the invention of
      the digital computer, the first was possibly the automatic flute player
       mentioned by the Musa brothers in Baghdad during the Islamic Golden Age
       in the 9th century. Since the early 1800s programs have been used to control
       the actions of machines such as Jacquard looms, music boxes and player pianos.
