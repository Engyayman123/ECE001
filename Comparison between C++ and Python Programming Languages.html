    <td>C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as a C programming
     language extension or 'C with classes.' The language has expanded significantly over time, and in
      addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation, modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic,
       and functional functions. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and several vendors
        have compilers for C++, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft , Intel, Oracle, and
         IBM, so it's available on many platforms.</td>
     <td>Python is a language of programming that is interpreted, of high level, of general 
     use. Python's design philosophy, developed by Guido van Rossum and first published in 1991,
      emphasizes the readability of code with its prominent use of large whitespace. The language
       constructs and object-oriented methodology are aimed at enabling programmers to write simple, 
     functional code for large and small projects. Python is typed dynamically, and collected from garbage.
      It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured programming (especially procedural), 
    object-oriented, and functional. Because of its extensive standard library, Python is also defined as "batteries included" language.</td>
